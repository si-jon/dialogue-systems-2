Thoughts about the lab: 
Except for some technical issues with connecting to the rasa server, I didn't 
run into any big problems. The trickiest part was navigating the tdm documentation, 
though I guess it is to be expected since it's a work in progress.
The tutorial session may have been a bit fast. Of course, it can be hard to tell 
as an instructor, unless students ask questions and make it apparent that they need 
more explanation about things. Other than that, I think the lab was a good 
introduction to tdm, which seems fun to work with!
